# Git Hooks

This is a simple repo for managing hooks.

Basically:

* Copy `hooks/` and `install-hooks.sh` into your project's root directory
* Run `./install-hooks.sh`
* Populate your hooks in the `hooks/*.d` folders

The hooks will run at the appropriate times. That's it!

Exit with an error code to abort the process.
